# Front End of Summer Doc Project

Chat GPT is an powerful language model that has the ability to give coherent, quick, and simple summaries. However the current Chat GPT application can only handle queries of a certain length (~300 words). Thus Summer Doc was formed under the idea to give a summary of any length of document. Summer Doc achieves this by splitting up the document into segmented API calls. The responses then are meshed together to achieve the overall summary. 

This webpage was created by James Korrell and Ben Sikora. The site is a single page React App built with Vite. For styling, we used Tailwind CSS.
